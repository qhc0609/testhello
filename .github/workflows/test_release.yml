# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: test_release

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
    tags: # 当我们提交代码为tag 是以'v'开头的时候才会触发自动部署到服务端 如 git push tag v0.1.0
      - 'v*'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
      # 第三步：发布 Release
      - name: Create Release # 创建Release，可以在仓库看到一个个版本
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }} # 之前GitHub添加的Token
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }} # (tag)标签名称
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          draft: false # 是否是草稿
          prerelease: false # 是否是预发布
